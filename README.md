****#Securing_MLOps_Pipeline_with_AWS****
This GitHub repo guides users to secure MLOps pipelines with AWS. Detailed steps cover CLI setup, IAM policies, S3 encryption, Lambda automation, and CloudWatch monitoring, empowering users to protect data and ensure operational resilience.
## Getting Started
To get started with securing your MLOps pipeline using AWS, follow these steps:
** Install AWS CLI**
#You can install AWS CLI using pip:
#pip install awscli

**Configure AWS CLI**
#Configure AWS CLI with your AWS access key ID, secret access key, default region, and output format:
#aws configure

**Create IAM Policy**: Create an IAM policy to define access controls for your MLOps resources. Replace `your-bucket-name` with your actual bucket name and `your-username` with your IAM username.

**Create S3 Bucket with Encryption**: Create an S3 bucket with default encryption enabled to protect your data at rest.

**Create Lambda Function**: Create a Lambda function to automate tasks within your MLOps pipeline.

**Create CloudWatch Log Group**: Create a CloudWatch log group to monitor and analyze logs generated by AWS services.

## Usage
Once you have configured your AWS environment and implemented the necessary security measures, you can integrate these steps into your MLOps pipeline to ensure secure operations.
